#Action!

##Road Map
So there are a variety of things that need to be completed for Action! to be ready for primetime. Some of them are basic (getting statemachine working), others are more complex (build tooling for troubleshooting event stacks). I am going to keep them here and make this a living document.

###TODOs before RC
0. Tooling for troubleshooting events
0. dependency resolution integration with state machines
0. ajax resolution/integration for models
0. Figure out the testing side of event driven FED in Action
0. Clone/ Deep Copy in the set functions
0. Revise the destroy function to make it really do what it needs to
0. Build out the save function for models
0. Add events into the error handler
0. Figure out how views really work... 
0. Consider web components
0. create a prod branch and a debug branch (prod probably doesn't need the extra weight of the call stack and emitterid stuff)

###Done
0. state machine support
0. Add emitter IDs to every time an event gets emitted for debugging work


#### Release Names
We'll use these guys as release names: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_action_film_actors

in order from top left - down the column then on to the next column. If we run out we'll add more names to the list :-)
