#Action!

##Road Map
So there are a variety of things that need to be completed for Action! to be ready for primetime. Some of them are basic (getting statemachine working), others are more complex (build tooling for troubleshooting event stacks). I am going to keep them here and make this a living document.

###TODOs before RC
0. Tooling for troubleshooting events
0. state machine support
0. dependency resolution integration with state machines
0. ajax resolution/integration for models
0. Figure out the testing side of event driven FED in Action
0. Clone/ Deep Copy in the set functions
0. Revise teh destroy function to make it really do what it needs to
0. Build out the save function for models
0. Add events into the error handler
0. Figure out how views really work...
